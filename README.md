"HappyBirthday" is my first ever Android App. It is a basic app that focuses on the actual usage of views, containers and constraints. It was built using Android Studio. The app was run on a virtual device which is called "Android Emulator". This emulator was created using the Android Virtual Device (AVD) manager.

Below is a Design view of the app in Android Studio:

FUTURE IMPROVEMENT:
I would work on the same app to make changes in the future. I will try to experiment more on the looks of the app.
